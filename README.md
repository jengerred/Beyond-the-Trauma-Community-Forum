# Beyond-the-Trauma-Community-Forum

## We propose to create an online forum called Beyond the Trauma Community Forum, a platform for women who are domestic violence survivors to find peer support, information, and resources. 

## Domestic violence is a pervasive and complex issue that affects millions of women worldwide. Many survivors face barriers to accessing support services, such as stigma, isolation, fear, or lack of resources. They may also struggle with emotional and psychological trauma, low self-esteem, and lack of empowerment. How can we create a safe and supportive online space for women who are domestic violence survivors to connect, share, and heal?


## We would like to implement more features including: 
    - A secure and anonymous registration and login process that protects the identity and privacy of the users.
    - A user-friendly and intuitive interface that allows users to navigate with ease
    - A moderation system that ensures the forum is free from harassment, abuse, or spam. 
    - A resource section that provides links to relevant and reliable sources of information and support services for domestic violence survivors, such as hotlines, shelters, counseling, legal aid, etc. Users can also suggest or request new resources to be added to the section.

# This project was created using React, see below for how to use and install on your local machine. 

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
